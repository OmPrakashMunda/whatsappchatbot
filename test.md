- Click the **Add** button to commence the movie upload process.

## 4. Alternative Movie Upload Options

Apart from the standard movie upload process, we offer three alternative options:

1. **From Dailymotion:** Upload a movie using a Dailymotion video URL.
2. **From Direct URL:** Accepts a direct URL to the video source.
3. **Add Record to Server:** Use this option if the video is already stored in the ITJ-Flix S3 bucket or server.

## 5. Monitoring Warnings and Alerts

Please pay close attention to warnings and alerts within the CMS:

- **Uploader Issues:** If you encounter problems during the upload process, don't hesitate to contact our senior developer for assistance.
- **Untrusted Sources:** In case the search algorithm identifies videos from untrusted sources, follow the actions outlined in the email notification.
- **Nothing Found:** If the search algorithm fails to find any videos, no further action is required.
- **Another Upload in Progress:** Due to server limitations, only one video can be uploaded at a time. Wait a few minutes and refresh the page if the upload is complete; the warning will automatically disappear.

**Additional Guidelines from the Email:**

- **Stable Network Connection:** To prevent interruptions during the upload process, ensure a stable network connection.
- **No Series Uploads:** Please note that series uploads are not permitted through the CMS platform.
- **Verification of Sources:** Prior to initiating an upload, verify video sources as per the instructions provided in the email.
- **WhatsApp Notifier:** Keep an eye on the WhatsApp notifier for accurate updates on ongoing movie uploads.

Your cooperation in adhering to these guidelines is pivotal in maintaining the quality and reliability of our CMS platform. Should you have any questions or encounter issues, do not hesitate to reach out to our senior developer for assistance.
